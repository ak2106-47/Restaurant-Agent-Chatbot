# 🍽️ Agentic Restaurant Chatbot  

An **AI-powered restaurant assistant** built with **Agenix** and **Google Gemini**, showcasing an **agentic approach** to tool use and orchestration.  

This is a demo project designed to highlight **LLM orchestration + agent tooling** skills for restaurant-related tasks such as:  
- 📜 Viewing the menu  
- 🛒 Placing food orders  
- 📅 Making table reservations  

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🤖 **Agentic design**: Each tool handles a specialized task (Menu, Orders, Reservations).  
- 🧩 **Modular tools**: Tools are registered directly in the agent, enabling flexible orchestration.  
- 💬 **Conversational UI**: Chat with the bot just like you would with a waiter.  
- 🔗 **Gemini LLM**: Powered by Google Gemini for natural, context-aware responses.  
- 🔥 **Showcase-ready**: Built to demonstrate **agent-based reasoning + tool use** in Flutter/Dart.
